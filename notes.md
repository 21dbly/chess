# My Notes

## OOP (in java)
- everything extends from Object
- each file must have exactly one highest level class
- any file/class can have up to one entry point ("main" method)
- overloading constructors:
  - default, parameterized, copy
  - `this(copy.value)`
- enums are classes too
- encapsulation: hiding the details. Only allow access if it's needed
- extend means inherit
- equals operator (==) always compares memory location. So basically only use it with primitive types
- .equals method for comparing classes

### Records
- for immutable objects like data
- automatically overrides equals, hashcode, tostring, and getters?
- can still add more functions

## immutability
- safer
